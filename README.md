Multi-soliton form factors in sine-Gordon model

Nature of problem:
The multi-soliton form factors of the sine-Gordon model (relevant in two dimensional physics) were given only by highly nontrivial integral representation with a limited domain of convergence. Practical applications of the form factors, e.g. calculation of correlation functions in two dimensional condensed matter systems, were not possible in general.

Solution method:
Using analytic continuation techniques an efficient algorithm is found and implemented in Mathematica, which provides a general and systematic way to calculate multi-soliton form factors in the sine-Gordon model. The package contains routines to compute the two-, four- and six-soliton form factors.
